# Welcome to my Github page!!!
## I am a student majoring in MIS

## Music is my therapy
some of my favoirte artists are:
- Beabadoobee
- Mitski
- Clairo
- Chlow Moriondo
- Jess Benko
- Billie Eilish
- and a lot more...

A very weird/interesting idea I came up with recently is to create a chatbot with model trained on data about myself. I know very little about machine learning and NLP but it I think it'll be cool to have someone exactly like yourself and be able to talk with that person.
I know that it won't be easy work, but the idea intrigues me.
